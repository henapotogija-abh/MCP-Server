## Run MCP Server with Claude
Go to Claude settings > Developer tab. Click on Edit config, which will point to `claude_desktop_config.json` file. This file might be empty at first, but in order to configure the MCP server to be discoverable to Claude, paste the following:

```
{
  "preferences": {
    "menuBarEnabled": false
  },
  "mcpServers": {
    "mock_company_data": {
      "command": "<system python filepath>",
      "args": ["<system filepath to the server from this repository>/MCP Server/server.py"],
      "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "<system filepath to this repository>r"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Quit and reopen Claude after saving these changes.
